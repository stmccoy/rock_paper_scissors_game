Overview of assignment

This was my first assignment working with Flask. I created a rock paper scissors game and I was really happy with how it turned out. I used a lot of conditional html, which I generated using jinja syntax, and I managed to get all the elements positioned as I wanted using CSS. When reflecting at the end of the assignment on what I could have improved, I think media queries would have improved the appearance of the app on wider screens. I made it on my 13 inch macbook pro, and when I moved it over to a bigger monitor the spaces between objects grew significantly. I'd also like to have added a background image, because looking at the project with fresh eyes the background seems a bit empty.


To run, ensure flask is installed on your computer. Then type 'flask run' in the main project folder.
